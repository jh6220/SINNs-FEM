    "- This is likely caused by the fact that there are no training patches around the corners and so the model will not learn how to handle them. The fix is ADDING THE CORNER TRAINING PATCHES INTO THE TRAINING DATASETS\n",
    "- Secondly there is a an attempt by the trained model at a smooth transition between the latent variables at boundary and in the interior of the domain but the transition has only the lenght of the interior encoder mask radius. On way to fix this could be adding x,y distances to the outer boundary / clossest boundary into the interior encoder input data.\n",
